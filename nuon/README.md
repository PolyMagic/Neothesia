Nuon is the most bare bones UI library you can imagine (by design)

Features:
- Lack of widgets
- Lack of trees and hierarchies
- Lack of rendering architecture of any kind
- Basic layouting helpers
- Handles mouse events for given set of elements and their bounding boxes

TODO:
- Handle focus and keyboard events as well
